# AI Design Prompts for Keto Macro Tracker

## 🤖 **Use AI to Generate Designs Instead of Figma**

### **Option 1: ChatGPT/Claude Prompts**

Copy these prompts into ChatGPT or Claude:

```
Create a modern iOS app design for a keto macro tracker app. 
Include:
- Today view with macro circles (protein, carbs, fat, calories)
- Progress bars showing daily goals
- Food logging interface
- Clean, minimal design with green accent color
- SF Symbols for icons
- Cards and rounded corners
- Show the layout in ASCII art format
```

### **Option 2: Midjourney/DALL-E Prompts**

```
Modern iOS app interface, keto macro tracker, health app design, 
clean minimal UI, green accent color, circular progress indicators, 
food logging cards, SF Symbols icons, professional mobile app design, 
high quality, detailed
```

### **Option 3: Figma AI Plugins**

Install these Figma plugins:
1. **Magician** - AI-powered design generation
2. **Automator** - Automate repetitive tasks
3. **Content Reel** - Auto-populate with content

## 🚀 **Skip Design - Go Straight to Code**

Since we already have:
- ✅ Complete design system (`DesignSystem.swift`)
- ✅ Working components (cards, buttons, progress bars)
- ✅ Color palette and typography
- ✅ SF Symbols integration

**Just use our code directly!**

## 💡 **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Skip Figma entirely**
2. **Use our `SimpleTodayView.swift`** (just created)
3. **Customize colors/text** as needed
4. **Build and test** in Xcode
5. **Iterate quickly** with code changes

## 🎯 **Why This is Better:**

- ✅ **Faster**: No manual design work
- ✅ **More accurate**: Code matches exactly
- ✅ **Easier to modify**: Change code, not designs
- ✅ **Already styled**: Uses our design system
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Replace your current TodayView** with `SimpleTodayView`
2. **Build and run** to see the result
3. **Customize** colors, text, or layout as needed
4. **Create other views** using the same approach

This way you get a professional-looking app without the tedious design work! 🎉
